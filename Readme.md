# Mice protein Data Modelling

This project covers the data science experiment on the Mice Proteins Dataset that are discriminant between
the classes. For the experiment, we were required to clean the data and build two data models. We also had
to read columns and then explain what the relationships are between columns. Once All the basic data
cleaning and analysis is finished, we were asked to create two machine learning model of either two
classification models or two clustering models. For this project, two classification models are created and
compared. The task is to create and train and improve the models as much as possible and to analyse and
suggest a model at the end of this experiment and justify why it is better than the other.
